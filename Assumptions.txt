Assumptions:

* All stations are presumed to be equip-distant.
* All tracks are assumed to be in a straight line, and on a flat surface without any form of gradient.
* All accelerations and decelerations are assumed to be instantaneous.

Considerations:

* The website is not responsive, please view on a desktop.
* The decision was made to build the website using vanilla JS, without using any plug-ins or libraries.
* Please refer to the JSON file to view which stations have got slow departures.
* Slow trains travel between stations in 4 seconds, and normal trains make the same journey in 2 seconds.
* An exposed module pattern has been used so that unit tests may be introduced later.
* This website was built in Chome OSX and has not been tested in any other browser.
* It is assumed it will work in most browsers, but it is known that the CSS transitions will fail in IE 9.
* The station intervals and departure intervals are configurable, and I have commented in some recommended settings to improve viewing performance.
